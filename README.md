# Life-of-Jack
This repository's purpose is to better organize my goals, hobbies, projects, etc
I'm 24 years old, work as a staff research associate for a neuroscience lab at UCSF, and have many long term goals. 
My goals include: 
1) attending UCSF MD program
2) making art in the form of music, sculpture, and electronics
3) one day owning a home in San Francisco that's big enough to house some friends and my family (including parents)
4) spread love through medical practice
